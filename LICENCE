# How to use the implementation plan

This plan acts as persistent memory between your sessions, eliminating the "where was I?" problem:

- Check it at session start to understand previous work
- Review decisions, blockers, and next tasks
- Maintain continuity across sessions
- Update it as you work rather than trying to remember at the end
- Update issue status when starting work
- Create sub-tasks when discovering new requirements
- Document blockers immediately
- Add code snippets and architectural decisions as comments

**Step 1.1: Title**

- **Task**: One line description
- **Context**: files and functions relevants to haave the information to complete the step.
- **Actions**:
- **Test**: A small simple unit test that can be integrated into the tests/testthat corpus
- **Status**: Not Started
  **Documentation:**
  Here you link to websites with documentation that the agent can use if it get stuck
